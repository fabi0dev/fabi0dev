I'm a software engineer, I have more than 7 years of experience in front-end development of mobile applications.

Also dominate back-end, I worked for a long time with PHP and nowadays I sometimes have close collaboration in this area, whether with Node.js, Next.js and even PHP itself, but since the rise of mobile and web applications With React, I focus on front-end development.
